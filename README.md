PUBLIC LICENSE FOR EXTENSIBLE SOFTWARE
Version 0.1 (Draft)

1. Definitions.

   1.0.1. "Core Software" means the central portion of the Covered Code as
   designated by the Initial Developer, including any modifications of such
   central portion. Core Software is subject to the strong copyleft rules
   defined in this License.

   1.0.2. "Extension" means a separate program, module, or plugin that adds
   functionality to the Core Software and interacts solely through its
   Public API. Extensions may be licensed under terms chosen by their
   authors, including proprietary terms.

   1.0.3. "Public API" means a documented and stable application programming
   interface of the Core Software that the Initial Developer has explicitly
   designated as open for third-party use.

   [Other definitions of MPL 1.1 remain unchanged: Contributor, Covered Code,
   Executable, Initial Developer, Larger Work, Modifications, Original Code,
   Patent Claims, Source Code, etc.]

2. Source Code License.

   2.1. Core Software.
        (a) If You modify the Core Software and use it to provide services
        to others over a computer network, You must make the complete
        Source Code of Your modified Core Software available under this
        License to all recipients of such services, free of charge.
        (b) This obligation applies whether or not You distribute the
        Executable version. This rule follows the spirit of the Affero GPL.

   2.2. Extensions.
        (a) If You develop an Extension that interacts only through the
        Public API, You may distribute it under any license of Your choice,
        including proprietary licenses.
        (b) If an Extension directly modifies or circumvents the Core
        Software (for example, via monkey patching or linking against
        internal, non-API symbols), such modifications are treated as
        Core Software Modifications and must be licensed under this License.

   2.3. Contributor Grant.
        Each Contributor grants the same rights as in MPL 1.1, with the
        modifications above applying to Core Software and Extensions.

3. Distribution Obligations.

   3.1. Core Modifications.
        Any Modifications to Core Software must be made available in
        Source Code form under this License.

   3.2. Extensions.
        Extensions developed solely through the Public API may be
        distributed under other licenses and are not subject to copyleft
        obligations.

   3.3. Mixed Works.
        A Larger Work combining Core Software with Extensions must comply
        with the obligations above: Core remains under this License,
        Extensions may be under separate licenses.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
   [Same as MPL 1.1]

5. Application of this License.
   This License applies to any Covered Code to which the Initial Developer
   has attached the ESPL notice in Exhibit A.

6. Versions of the License.
   [Same as MPL 1.1]

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
   [Same as MPL 1.1]

8. TERMINATION.
   [Same as MPL 1.1]

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   [Same as MPL 1.1]

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    [Same as MPL 1.1]

11. MISCELLANEOUS.
    [Same as MPL 1.1]

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    [Same as MPL 1.1]

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
